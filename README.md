# Salary-Prediction
Simple Linear Regression: Salary Prediction
Overview
This project demonstrates the use of a Simple Linear Regression model to predict salaries based on years of experience. Using a dataset of salaries and experience, the project trains the model, evaluates its performance, visualizes results, and saves the trained model for future deployment using pickle.

Features
>Data Preprocessing: 
  Split data into independent (X) and dependent (y) variables.
>Model Training:
  Train a Simple Linear Regression model using the scikit-learn library.
>Visualization:
  Training data with regression line.
  Test data with regression line.
>Model Evaluation:
  Calculate bias (training score).
  Calculate variance (test score).
  Model Saving: Save the trained model for deployment using pickle.
  Prediction: Forecast salaries for unseen years of experience.
